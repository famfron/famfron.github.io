                    I'm just a dude trying to make my way through the world. What you
                    find here is just a collection of the many thoughts and wonders that
                    interest me. You might find poems, games, books, rants, or anything
                    else. This is me. This is who I am. And as I grow I don't know where
                    this journey will take me. Likely this website will grow with me, and
                    the format and layout may change, but the content never will. When
                    something goes up, it stays. That is my promise. To myself, moreso
                    than anyone else. The things that I put here are to serve as a 
                    reminder of the things that once were. To inspire me, and to drive 
                    me forward. That in the end I may leave my mark upon this world. That
                    I will never be lost, but may be found.

                    There are definitely things in life that have no meaning. Things
                    done simply for the sake of doing them. These are the things that people
                    tend to look down upon, that people judge others for doing. Was there really
                    a point to me playing so many hours of video games, to me making YouTube
                    videos for 4 years in the hopes of blowing up. No, looking back, there wasn't.
                    But that never stopped me. That never made me think to myself that 'Hey, maybe
                    this wouldn't be a good use of time.', or something like that. But that doesn't
                    matter, and neither does me writing all of this out.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-text">
                    That isn't going to stop me from doing it though. I am doing this because I
                    want to, and because it's something that I enjoy. Sure, part of me is hoping
                    that something will come from this, whether it's a job or motivation or
                    anything else. There's always that little part that wants for something to
                    randomly blow up, to go viral. Maybe this, maybe this one is the key, the goldmine
                    that will finally launch me into global recognition. And so I continue. I
                    continue doing the pointless things, the things that I want to do, because that 
                    one thing, that one small hope, is something that I will never be able to let
                    go of. Something that will always be sitting in the back of my head.
