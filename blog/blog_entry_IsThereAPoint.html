                        There are definitely things in life that have no meaning. Things
                        done simply for the sake of doing them. These are the things that people
                        tend to look down up, that people judge others for doing. Was there really
                        a point to me playing so many hours of video games, to me making YouTube
                        videos for 4 years in the hopes of blowing up. No, looking back, there wasn't.
                        But that never stopped me. That never made me think to myself that 'Hey, maybe
                        this wouldn't be a good use of time.', or something like that. But that doesn't
                        matter, and neither does me writing all of this out.

                        That isn't going to stop me from doing it though. I am doing this because I
                        want to, and because it's something that I enjoy. Sure, part of me is hoping
                        that something will come from this, whether it's a job or motivation or
                        anything else. There's always that little part that wants for something to
                        randomly blow up, to go viral. Maybe this, maybe this one is the key, the goldmine
                        that will finally launch me into global recognition. And so I continue. I
                        continue doing the pointless things, the things that I want to do, because that 
                        one thing, that one small hope, is something that I will never be able to let
                        go of. Something that will always be sitting in the back of my head.
