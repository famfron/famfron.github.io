                    I'm just a dude trying to make my way through the world. What you
                    find here is just a collection of the many thoughts and wonders that
                    interest me. You might find poems, games, books, rants, or anything
                    else. This is me. This is who I am. And as I grow I don't know where
                    this journey will take me. Likely this website will grow with me, and
                    the format and layout may change, but the content never will. When
                    something goes up, it stays. That is my promise. To myself, moreso
                    than anyone else. The things that I put here are to serve as a 
                    reminder of the things that once were. To inspire me, and to drive 
                    me forward. That in the end I may leave my mark upon this world. That
                    I will never be lost, but may be found.
